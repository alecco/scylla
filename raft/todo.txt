1. log_finer() races with append_entries(), need to find a solution
2. stable_to() does not support truncation
3. stable_to() updates leader's state but called on non leader as well
4. make leader state optional so the error above will be obvious
5. low prio: drop _my_id from fsm, it should be a server property.
