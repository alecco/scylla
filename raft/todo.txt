* log_fiber() races with append_entries(), need to find a solution
* stable_to() does not support truncation
* stable_to() updates leader's state but called on non leader as well
* low prio: drop _my_id from fsm, it should be a server property.
* Put back load_vote() and load_term()
* when switching to leader state, we currently assume each follower
  is at the current term and match_idx is 0. We need to extend AppendEntries
  RPC  to efficiently inform the leader about the follower position.
