* log_fiber() races with append_entries(), need to find a solution
* stable_to() does not support truncation
* stable_to() updates leader's state but called on non leader as well
* low prio: drop _my_id from fsm, it should be a server property.
* Put back load_vote() and load_term()
* when switching to leader state, we currently assume each follower
  is at the current term and match_idx is 0. We need to extend AppendEntries
  RPC  to efficiently inform the leader about the follower position.
* there is a tricky dependency between follower_state lifetime
  and replication_fiber. We destroy leader_state inside the FSM
  without regard to replication_fiber keeping a reference to it,
  so unless replication_fiber is super-careful to not touch the
  reference if !leader, we will get a crash. Another
  possibility when the two can get out of sync is a ocnfiguration
  change, which is applied to FSM first, and replication
  fibers stopped second.
  The safest bet would be to resolve _leadership_transition
  future *before* state machine state change, not after.
* add a test case when we can't commit even though followers
  have made progress, but the term has changed.
