* class log exception safety & tests (error injections)
* consider not resetting election timer on request_vote().
* low prio: drop _my_id from fsm, it should be a server property.
* Put back load_vote() and load_term()
* when switching to leader state, we currently assume each follower
  is at the current term and match_idx is 0. We need to extend AppendEntries
  RPC  to efficiently inform the leader about the follower position.
* add a test case when we can't commit even though followers
  have made progress, but the term has changed.
* change typed_uint64 to typed_int64
* the algorithm for finding the first matching index
  that uses linear search is both costly, cumbersome and most likely inefficient
  in practice. etcd raft uses lastIndex() of the follower as a RejectHint, and
  if it doesn't work, resets matchIndex to 0. We could try the same strategy
  and use LastIndex() or CommitIndex(). The follower's commit index is
  guaranteed to have the same term as the leader. This will
  cover the two most common use cases: there is a gap between the
  follower and the leader, so the leader simply sends this gap,
  or, if there were multiple elections and multiple terms have passed,
  the new leader simply resends all entries starting from the committed
  one.
* implement log snapshotting
* implement flow control and batching in replication_fiber
  currently it send out the first non matching entry in a loop,
  so it will send the same entry again and again until reply is received
  and match_idx is adjusted. The logic should be fixed to send several batched
  requests and do not resend before certain time passes.
* implement leader step down
* implement pre-vote and sticky leadership
* implement cluster configuration changes
* introduce class progress that instantiates match array
* remove last_stable from log_fiber
* harmonize tracing by implementing operator << for fsm and log
* implement overload protection by ignoring step/tick if get_output()
  wasn't called.
